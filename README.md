This "game" is a proof of concept of having a game with a designed big map with around 300 connected rooms. Most rooms are without any content or game play. I plan to fork this game to have as a base to build a game with actual content in later. Since I might redo a lot of things I want to just upload this current version here as for preservation. Also I want to adress that I based much of the map of an existing game that I do not have the rights of.

## The Map

The world consists of these domains
+ echo valley
+ ghost town
+ cream tunnel
+ muddy york
+ pirate ship
+ crystalline
+ swampifornia
+ babylonia
+ bridge ruby
+ madness
+ ufo
+ infernoasia

## The music
I decide not to upload the music this project but it can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eiijm2GhKAA , if you download it as an mp3 and put in the res folder and set MUSIC = 1 in config it should work.
